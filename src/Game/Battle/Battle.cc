/******************************************************************************
* Class Name: Battle Implementation
* Date Created: December 2nd, 2012
* Inheritance:
* Description: 
*
*  TODO: CONSTRUCTORS TO BE FINISHED
*
* Notes: Turn Progression:
*
* 1. generalUpkeep() adjusts all values based on Weather.  BattleInfoBar
* displays info on these adjustments * after X seconds, personalUpkeep() is 
* called.
*
* 2. personalUpkeep() adjusts all values of the Person represented by 
* party_index. PersonalUpkeep() then, after X seconds, activates and 
* initializes BattleMenu with party_index's relevant options.
*
* 3. Once an option from BattleMenu is selected processAction() is
* called and party_index is incremented, then if it is less
* than 5, personalUpkeep is called (Step 2).  Else, BattleMenu 
* deactivates and processEnemyActions() is called (Step 4).
*
* 4. processEnemyActions() uses the enemies scripts to add actions to the
* stack, after which orderActions() is called.
*
* 5. orderActions() reorders the stack based on speed and status ailments,
* performActions() is then called.
*
* 6. performAction() takes the first Action on the stack and loads it into 
* action_animate which then shows the Actions animation.  The Action is then 
* removed from the stack.
*
* 7. action_animate emits a finished(Action *) signal which is connected to
* changeStats(Action *), changeStats(Action *) alters each Person's stats 
* based off its parameter Action.  UpdateScene() is then called.
*
* 8. updateScene() emits a finished() signal which is connected to 
* actionOutcome(). ActionOutcome() checks for deaths and animates 
* appropriately, if a whole party is eliminated, then all the memory
* is cleared, and battleWon() or battleLost() is called.  If the stack is not
* empty, (Step 6) else reset party_index and (Step 1).
*   
* Note: Animation has changed since this design and requires some alteration 
*     in terms of these steps.
*  
* In Battle Action Animations
* ----------------------------
* Action Timer is removed
* For actions that occur during battle, the animations will only be targets
* of the player and centered on them. For example, there will be a sequence 
* of sprites where it will animate (based on a timer) and flash on the target 
* and possibly flash on the caster itself. These will be attached to the action
* class and will occur during the generation of the action in the step 6? This
* could be tied into the action paint event to draw on the battle screen These 
* would utilize the sprite class which already has a linked list to generate 
* the sequences of the animation. How would this be programmed in? Attached 
* to the database since we generated a sequence within action to program in 
* actions and commands that can be used in the battle sequence. An addition 
* to that sequence to include frames or generate generic ones that everyone 
* has to share.
